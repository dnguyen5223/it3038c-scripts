For this project we will be Creating a Chatbot with python and ChatGPT.  Throughout this project we will need to create an Openai account to recieve an API key. This API key will allow you to use ChatGPT reply to answer questions as if ChatGPT is a cybersecurity expert.  When running this code you will be able to share your link with the embedded module gradio. At the end of the code it will print a web server IP where you will be able to ask it questions or send the second link to your friend.  This project is a very unique and brand new project that recently been posted showing the interesting new advance technology of AI. This code will help you dip your toes into understanding how API calls can bring AI into a new world!!  Enjoy this one it is pretty cool!!
